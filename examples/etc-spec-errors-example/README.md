# etc-embedded-config-example

Similar to
the
[etc-plain-example](https://github.com/roman/Haskell-etc/tree/master/examples/etc-plain-example) app
with the difference that this example uses
the [file-embed](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/file-embed) package to
embed the configuration spec file in the executable binary.

the [`etc` homepage](https://github.com/roman/Haskell-etc)
